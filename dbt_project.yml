# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
# directory structure here overrides the definition of paths above
# 
models:    # this must be a sub-directory under the project directory
           # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/
   example:
      +materialized: view

              #[ "DELETE FROM scratch.workspace.EMP" ]
              ( "DELETE FROM CURRENT_DATE()"  )
